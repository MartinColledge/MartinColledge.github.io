Currently a post-doc at Géoazur laboratory, trying my hand at numerical modelling of earthquake ruptures and seismicity swarms.

Interested in the relation between the secular and the transient, in rock mechanics and seismology, working on laboratory experiments, catalogues, and simulations.
In it for the long-run and a passion for learning.
