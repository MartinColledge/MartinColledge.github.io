I work as a *Maître de Conférences* in Geophysics at the [Institut de physique du globe de Paris] [IPGP]. 

My reseach focuses on measuring deformation of Earth's surface with satellite radar 
interferometry (InSAR) to study the dynamics of active continental faults and aquifers. 
Together with the physical understanding of what leads to an earthquake, 
I am interested in methodological improvements for automatic processing of 
large amount of observations and for environmental applications of InSAR. 

Currently, I focus on underground water storage variations in Pakistan and California, 
as well as error and biases propagation in InSAR time series.
