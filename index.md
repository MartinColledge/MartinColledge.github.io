I am a postdoctoral researcher in Geophysics at the [French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission] [CEA] 
and the [Ecole Normale Supérieure] [LG]. I defended my PhD thesis in December 2021.

I look at the deformation of Earth's surface with satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) 
to study the dynamics of active continental faults and aquifers. 
Together with the physical understanding of what leads to an earthquake, 
I am interested in methodological improvements for automatic processing of 
large amount of observations and for environmental applications of InSAR. 

In my current research, I focus on underground water storage variations in Pakistan and California, 
as well as error and biases propagation in InSAR time series.
