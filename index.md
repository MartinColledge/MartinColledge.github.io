I am a postdoctoral researcher in Geophysics at the [Laboratoire de Géologie] [LG] 
in [Ecole Normale Supérieure] [ENS]. I defended my PhD thesis under the 
supervision of Dr. [Romain Jolivet] [ROMAIN] on the 7th of December 2021.

I look at the deformation of Earth's surface with satelitte Radar images (more specifically, with InSAR) 
to study the dynamics of active continental fault zone. Together with the physical understanding 
of the earthquake cycle, I am interested in methodological improvements for automatic processing of 
large amount of observations. 

In my current research, I focus on the Chaman fault zone, in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
